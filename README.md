## Description
Challenge 11 coursework for UT bootcamp. Uses Heroku and Express.js. </br>
This is a note-taker application, hosted in-browser, and will take </br>
user input for adding a new note, deleting saved notes, and clearing </br>
an open note form. Saved notes can also be clicked on to display information. </br>

## What I Have Learned
I learned a lot about connecting back-end functionality to the front-end. </br>
I learned to use a server file to host routes, making route files that connect </br>
with the .html files, and communicate with the script .js file. Data can be  </br>
saved to a .json file, and edited through the front-end interaction. </br>
